# FlockLib
A Java library for my daily coding needs

# About
This is my (not so private anymore) java library I use for some coding projects. It is by far not complete and code that is on here might not be stable!
I also test a lot of things in this lib, I mostly try to write stuff on my own to minimize using 3rd party libs alltogether.
